# Raivcoo Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), built for **Raivcoo**, a platform designed to help video editors create and share portfolios.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the project in action.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page will auto-update as you make changes.
